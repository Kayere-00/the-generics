                Diverse Portfolio: Sandoz is not just limited to traditional generics; it is also a leader in biosimilarsâ€”biologic drugs that are similar to, 
                but not identical to, the original branded biologic products. Its biosimilars portfolio includes treatments for conditions like cancer, autoimmune diseases, and diabetes.

                Biosimilars Leadership: Sandoz has been a pioneer in biosimilars,
                with products like Zarxio, the first biosimilar to be approved by 
                the U.S. FDA, and Hercules, a biosimilar for treatment of cancer-related conditions.
